    <p>I have spent the last 5 years as a Unit Manager for Capital One, managing a team of 15-20 phone agents and case
    workers. I have spent this time honing my leadership and influencing skills, and I am comfortable presenting in
    front of large groups. My management style is based on developing an enviornemt of trust where the team feels
    comfortable failing and learning from those failures. This gives my agents the comfort to experiment together and
    iterate quickly. I got into coding because people mangement has not tapped into my creative problem solving skills. I have
    really enjoyed having to think about my work in a totally different way, and I love the instant gratification of
    making a website or fixing an error.</P>

    <p id="p2">In my free time I love hangin out with my wife and 3 kids. I'm a big sports fan, and I play a lot of fantasy sports. My wife and I enjoy binge watching Netflix, going to baseball games, and visitng aquariums.</p>
